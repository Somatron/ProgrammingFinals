    Mediterranean cookery has been originated for hundreds of years. 
    Originated by the people of the Mediterranean sea
    (Which comes from the name Mediterranean sea), spreaded through 
    regions of Meghrebi, Egyptian, Levantine, Ottoman (Turkish), 
    Italian, Greek, French, and in some places, Spanish. It consists
    of Olive, Wheat, and Grape, the three main elements. With additional
    sides of bread, pasta, and wine.

    <p>Now most would argue the fact that it has been mixed with Spanish food,
    but since both regions have different cultural aspects, it contrasts
    from that statement.

    For example, Grape dominated between 7,000 and 4,000 BC, and were used
    mostly for winemaking and vinegar as basics of creating a mediterranean diet.
